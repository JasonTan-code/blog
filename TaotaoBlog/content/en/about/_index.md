Hi, my name is **Taotao Tan**. I am a master's student at New York University, and expect to graduate in September 2021. My area of research interest is to apply various statistical and bioinformatic methods to uncover the biological system (genomic & transcriptomic). Currently I am working on a project **ShinyGenes**, a standalone application that integrates multiple bioinformatics tools.
